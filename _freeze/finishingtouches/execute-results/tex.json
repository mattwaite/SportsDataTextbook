The elements of a good graphic are:\n\n* Headline\n* Chatter\n* The main body\n* Annotations\n* Labels\n* Source line\n* Credit line\n\nThat looks like:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/chartannotated.png){width=3.11in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Graphics vs visual stories\n\nWhile the elements above are nearly required in every chart, they aren't when you are making visual stories. \n\n* When you have a visual story, things like credit lines can become a byline.\n* In visual stories, source lines are often a note at the end of the story. \n* Graphics don’t always get headlines – sometimes just labels, letting the visual story headline carry the load.\n\n[An example from The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/14/business/economy/inflation-prices.html). Note how the charts don't have headlines, source or credit lines.\n\n## Getting ggplot closer to output\n\nLet's explore fixing up ggplot's output before we send it to a finishing program like Adobe Illustrator.

Note the width and the height are from our knitr parameters at the top -- you have to repeat them or the graph will export at the default 7x7. \n\nIf there's more work you want to do with this graph that isn't easy or possible in R but is in Illustrator, simply change the file extension to `pdf` instead of `png`. The pdf will open as a vector file in Illustrator with everything being fully editable. \n\n## Waffle charts require special attention\n\nFrequently in my classes, students use the waffle charts library quite extensively to make graphics. This is a quick walkthough on how to get a waffle chart into a publication ready state. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(waffle)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's look at the offensive numbers from the 2018 Nebraska v. Wisconsin football game. Nebraska lost 41-24, but Wisconsin gained only 15 yards more than Nebraska did. You can find the [official stats on the NCAA's website](https://www.ncaa.com/game/football/fbs/2018/10/06/nebraska-wisconsin/team-stats).\n\nI'm going to make two vectors for each team and record rushing yards and passing yards. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nne <- c(\"Rushing\"=111, \"Passing\"=407, 15)\nwi <- c(\"Rushing\"=370, \"Passing\"=163, 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSo what does the breakdown of Nebraska's night look like? How balanced was the offense? \n\nThe waffle library can break this down in a way that's easier on the eyes than a pie chart. We call the library, add the data, specify the number of rows, give it a title and an x value label, and to clean up a quirk of the library, we've got to specify colors. \n\n**ADDITIONALLY**\n\nWe can add labels and themes, but you have to be careful. The waffle library is applying it's own theme, but if we override something they are using in their theme, some things that are hidden come back and make it worse. So here is an example of how to use ggplot's `labs` and the theme to make a fully publication ready graphic. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwaffle(ne/10, rows = 5, xlab=\"1 square = 10 yards\", colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Nebraska vs Wisconsin on offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers couldn't get much of a running game going.\",\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Matt Waite\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finishingtouches_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBut what if we're using a waffle iron? And what if we want to change the output size? It gets tougher. \n\nTruth is, I'm not sure what is going on with the sizing. You can try it and you'll find that the outputs are ... unpredictable. \n\nThings you need to know about waffle irons:\n\n* They're a convenience method, but all they're really doing is executing two waffle charts together. If you don't apply the theme to both waffle charts, it breaks.\n* You will have to get creative about applying headline and subtitle to the top waffle chart and the caption to the bottom. \n* Using ggsave doesn't work either. So you'll have to use R's pdf output. \n\nHere is a full example. I start with my waffle iron code, but note that each waffle is pretty much a self contained thing. That's because a waffle iron isn't really a thing. It's just a way to group waffles together, so you have to make each waffle individually. My first waffle has the title and subtitle but no x axis labels and the bottom one has not title or subtitle but the axis labels and the caption.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niron(\n waffle(\n   ne/10, \n   rows = 2, \n   xlab=\"Nebraska\",\n   colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + \n   labs(\n     title=\"Nebraska vs Wisconsin: By the numbers\", \n     subtitle=\"The Huskers couldn't run, Wisconsin could.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(\n   wi/10, \n   rows = 2, \n   xlab=\"Wisconsin\\n1 square = 10 yards\", \n   colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + \n   labs(caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Matt Waite\")\n) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finishingtouches_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-17-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Advanced text wrangling\n\nSometimes, you need a little more help with text than what is easily available. Sometimes you want a little more in your finishing touches. Let's work on some issues common in projects that can be fixed with new new libraries: multi-line chatter, axis labels that need more than just a word, axis labels that don't fit, and additional text boxes.\n\nFirst things first, we'll need to install `ggtext` with install.packages. Then we'll load it.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggtext)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's bo back to our scatterplot above. As created, it's very simple, and the chatter doesn't say much. Let's write chatter that instead of being super spare is more verbose.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's underperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense changing systems and struggling to stop opponents. But if you compare the offense to every other offense and how many points they score vs the number of yards they roll up, NU underperformed.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Matt Waite\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Nebraska 2018\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finishingtouches_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can see the problem right away -- it's too long and gets cut off. One way to fix this is to put `\\n` where you think the line break should be. That's a newline character, so it would add a return there. But with ggtext, you can use simple HTML to style the text, which opens up a lot of options. We can use a <br> to break the line and we can use `*` to italicize the word \"underperformed\" to add emphasis. The other thing we need to do is in the theme element, change the `element_text` for plot.subtitle to `element_markdown`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's underperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense changing systems and struggling to stop opponents. But if you compare<br>the offense to every other offense and how many points they score vs the number of yards they roll up, NU *underperformed*.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Matt Waite\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Nebraska 2018\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finishingtouches_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith ggtext, there's a lot more you can do with CSS, like change the color of text, that I don't recommend. Also, there's only a few HTML tags that have been implemented. For example, you can't add links because the `a` tag hasn't been added. \n\nAnother sometimes useful thing you can do is add much more explanation to your axis labels. This is going to be a silly example because \"Points per game\" is pretty self-explanatory, but roll with it. First, we create an unusually long y axis label, then, in theme, we add some code to `axis.title.y`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game is an imperfect metric of offensive efficiency because defenses and special teams score points as well.\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's underperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense changing systems and struggling to stop opponents. But if you compare<br>the offense to every other offense and how many points they score vs the number of yards they roll up, NU *underperformed*.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Matt Waite\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_textbox_simple(\n      orientation = \"left-rotated\",\n      width = grid::unit(2.5, \"in\")\n    )\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Nebraska 2018\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finishingtouches_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne last advanced trick: Adding a text box explainer in the graphic. This should be used in somewhat rare circumstances -- you don't want to pollute your data space with lots of text. If your graphic needs so much explainer text, you should be asking yourself hard questions about if your chart is clearly telling a story.\n\nTo add a text box explainer, you need to add a `geom_textbox` to your chart. The code below does that, and also adds a `geom_point` to anchor the box to a spot. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  geom_textbox(\n    aes(x=500, \n        y=25, \n        label=\"Dots below the blue line indicate offenses that scored fewer points than their yards per game would suggest they should.\", \n        orientation = \"upright\", \n        hjust=0, \n        vjust=1), width = unit(2.8, \"in\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=500, y=25), size=2) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's underperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense changing systems and struggling to stop opponents.
